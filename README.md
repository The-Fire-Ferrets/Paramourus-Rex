# Paramourus Rex
In the post-apocalyptic dinosaur era, Phillip Osoraptor must win the heart of 
childhood crush Diana Tyrana from other suitors by crafting her flowers that 
remind her of a time before a meteor struck the earth. After receiving “hints” 
from Diana, the player must collect flowers from one of  five levels, after 
which they must attempt to craft the flowers together into  one Diana would 
like, or else risk losing her to another suitor; we expect these  elements will 
appeal to college students and casual gamers. In levels, players have a limited 
number of vases with which to hold flowers, and these are used up when 
collecting flowers or when interacting with  obstacles and enemies.
