	<Dialogue Text = "Your name is Phillip Osoraptor, and you've finally moved back to your home valley, reuniting with one of your only childhood friends, Diana Tyrana." Background = ""/>
	<Dialogue Text = "Diana seems to remember you fondly, but you find yourself nervous and stuttering whenever your herds meet at the watering hole. Each day you tell yourself it'll work out better tomorrow." Background = "" />

	<Dialogue Text = "It's been a few months since then, and your once lush and beautiful valley is now barren and dry. There are no more Raptor Races or games of Brontosaurus Ball; most herds are migrating out of the valley in a desperate hope for survival." Background = ""/>

	<Dialogue Text = "The valley still feels too much like home to me to leave just yet. I guess I mostly just miss how green everything was. I mean, I'm no herbivore, but that doesn't mean I couldn't still appreciate all the flower fields, you know?" Background = "" />
	<Dialogue Text = "Just wishful thinking, I guess. Anyway, I better get back to my herd... It was nice talking to you, Phil." Background = "" />
