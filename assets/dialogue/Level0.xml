		"The year is 65,000,000 B.C. and life is pretty okay -- or as okay as it gets as the son of a travelling VelociReporter.  Your name is Phillip Osoraptor, and you've finally moved back to your home valley, reuniting with one of your only childhood friends, Diana Tyrana.  Diana seems to remember you fondly, but you find yourself nervous and stuttering whenever your herds meet at the watering hole. Each day you tell yourself it'll work out better tomorrow.  With hopes of reconnecting with Diana in your heart and maybe finally settling down, life in your new valley seems hopeful and promising.  ...Well, until the whole meteor thing happens at least.  It's been a few months since then, and your once lush and beautiful valley is now barren and dry. There are no more Raptor Races or games of Brontosaurus Ball; most herds are migrating out of the valley in a desperate hope for survival.  But way more importantly, everyone's trying to get with your girl.  With many of the female dinosaurs gone, everyone's attention has turned to Diana to try to continue their species survival.  If only there were some way to finally show her that you cared about her first..."/>

		"Hey, Phil! It's good to see a friendly face around... It's been kind of lonely since the meteor, what with everyone leaving, huh.  The valley still feels too much like home to me to leave just yet. I guess I mostly just miss how green everything was. I mean, I'm no herbivore, but that doesn't mean I couldn't still appreciate all the flower fields on a nice sunny day, you know?  Just wishful thinking, I guess. Anyway, I better get back to my herd... It was nice talking to you, Phil."/>
	<Dialogue Speaker = "Narrator" Text = "As Diana leaves, you notice your caveman friend Homer walking up to you.  Most folks around here tend to avoid him, thinking that as a human he is not very sophisticated.  You and Diana learned as children however, that what he lacked in sophistication, he made up for in heart.  It also helped that he was the only one in the valley with opposable thumbs."/>
  <Dialogue Speaker = "Homer" Text = "Phil look sad.  Homer want know what wrong?  ...Oh, Phil still like pretty Diana lady.  She say she miss sun and flowers, Phil make her SunFlower, she feel much better.  Phil come with Homer, Homer make SunFlower so Phil give nice Diana lady.  Then she know Phil love her!"/>
	<Dialogue Speaker = "Narrator" Text = "You're a bit skeptical.  But Homer hasn't let you down before, so you set out in search of the flowers he mentioned."/>
