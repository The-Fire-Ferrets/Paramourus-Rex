		<Dialogue ID="1" Text="Oh, hey Phil! Hugh stopped by earlier and told me that you're the one that found this Sunflower... I don't know how in the world you found it, but it's incredible! It made me feel all bright and cheerful again. If there weren't so much dust around I'd go find a good sunning rock. I hate all this dust and ash - it was so much nicer when the air was all crisp and clean, huh? I love sunning on a cold day. " Background="">

I don't know how you found something growing with all this dust and ash in the air. It was so much nicer when the air was all crisp and clean, huh? What I wouldn't do to breathe in some fresh air!"
