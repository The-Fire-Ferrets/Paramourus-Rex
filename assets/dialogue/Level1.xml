I don't know how in the world you found it, but it's incredible! It made me feel all bright and cheerful again. If there weren't so much dust around I'd go find a good sunning rock. I hate all this dust and ash - it was so much nicer when the air was all crisp and clean, huh? I love sunning on a cold day." Background = ""/>
