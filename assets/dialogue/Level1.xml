	<Commentary Text = "This is your time to shine, Phil! Whenever you deliver a flower to Diana, you have two ways of impressing her. First, she'll be impressed if the flower you've brought her corresponds to something she mentioned before your most recent adventure. For example, you've brought her a Sunflower today because she mentioned the other day that she enjoyed sunbathing. Future hints won't be so clear! Generally speaking, if she alludes to an element when talking to you, you should craft her a flower that uses that element."/>
	<Commentary Text = "The other way to make a good impression is through your dialogue choices. Sometimes Diana will ask you a question, and you'll have two choices of response. She's a smart lady, and she'll know if you're just telling her what she wants to hear. All I can really say is that you should be honest-- and don't be a jerk, I suppose. When prompted, choose your response by pressing 1 or 2 on the keypad."/>
