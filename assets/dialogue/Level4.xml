It made me feel all bright and cheerful again, like it was sunny outside again. It's too bad there's so much dust around -- normally I'd go find a good sunning rock after getting a drink. I hate all this dust and ash - it was so much nicer when the air was all crisp and clean, huh? I feel like you'd have to be all the way up in the mountains to get a breath of fresh air nowadays. Do you like mountaineering Phil?" />
