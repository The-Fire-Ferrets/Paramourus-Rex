And I'm really glad that you ended up staying. It's a good to have someone to talk to nowadays. I'd actually like to talk to you more... I've kind of had a huge crush on you for a while. I was hoping that you would go out with me some time?" Background="">

		<Dialogue ID="1" Text="Oh, hey, Phil... Nice of you to stop by. I'm glad you're here, actually. I wanted to let you know that I think this is all getting to be just a little too much for me. I have a few cousins who live in a the mountains a ways off, and I think I'm going to go live with them. I'm tired of all the other guys here bugging me. I figured I'd let you know before I headed out. It was nice knowing you, Phil. It's too bad we couldn't really reconnect since you came back." Background="">
