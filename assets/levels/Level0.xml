You can also press the M key to show the map and pause the game. The green dot is you, and the red X is your target: a FireFlower. Go pick it up, or press the Back Button in the bottom-left corner, if you're a quitter." />

If it the timer in the bottom right hand corner hits zero, you've run out of stamina and will pass out.  If you do faint, I'll come and bail you out, but I'm also going to eat the flowers. Go get the next one, Phil." />

Only when you're out of immediate danger, or you've taken all the flowers you can take, I'll show up. It won't work now since I'm already helping you, but you can press the C button to call me. Be carefull though: other T-Rexes will hear you call and come to the area. If I disappear occasionally, it's probably because you're suddenly in danger again - I don't want to be chased by a dinosaur!" />
